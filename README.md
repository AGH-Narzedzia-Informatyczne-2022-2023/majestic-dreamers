Creating snake with Python, how ironic?

As a team of young and ambitious IT students we decided to create a brand new version of a classic and beloved game - snake. It will include many brand new functions that original snake didn't have, such as collecting apples. The graphics will also be improved. Instead of a stark original one, we will use beautiful pixel art for our game.
