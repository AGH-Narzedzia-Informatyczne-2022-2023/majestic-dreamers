Creating snake with Python, how ironic?

As a team of young and ambitious IT students, we decided to create a brand new version of a classic and beloved game - snake. The game will include numerous brand new features that the original snake did not have, such as collecting apples. The graphics will also be improved. Instead of the dull and uninteresting appearance of the original game, we will use some beautiful pixel art for our version of it.

Our Snake is based on the idea of combining this classic game with roguelike. Eat more to become bigger, defeat enemies and infinite dungeons in your quest for power and glory.
